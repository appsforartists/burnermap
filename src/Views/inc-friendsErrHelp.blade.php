    <center><h3>It looks like we can't find any friends for you :-\</h3></center>
    <p>
    Either you really don't have any Facebook friends who are using BurnerMap [yet], or something went wrong. 
    Many burners don't let BurnerMap access their Facebook friends list out of habit. 
    But BurnerMap is <b><i>only</i></b> useful and fun if it can connect you with your friends.
    </p><p>
    <b class="red">If you expected to see some friends mapped here, please follow these steps,<br />
    <i>in order...</i></b>
