<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
This Privacy Policy was last modified on August 8, 2011, and was first published and made effective on August 8, 2011 
("Effective Date"). BurnerLove LLC ("BurnerLove," "BurnerMap," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information 
about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours is collected by BurnerMap when 
you use our Service, how the information is used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion 
of that information. This Privacy Policy also governs any information that you may have provided to BurnerMap prior 
to the Effective Date of this Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means 
(including offline) or from other sources.
<br /><br />

<u>I. Information We Collect.</u>
<br /><br />
<b>User-Provided Information:</b> You provide us information about yourself in various ways when you use the Service. 
For example, you provide us with information such as your name, your friend list, and other personal information when 
you use Facebook to connect to the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email 
messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service. You may 
provide us information in User Content you post to the Service, and you can optionally provide us with your email 
address.
<br /><br />
<b>Cookies Information:</b> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing 
a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie may also convey 
information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A 
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your 
browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. 
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all 
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if 
the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
<br /><br />
<b>Log File Information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web 
page or other web-based content. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file 
information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, 
browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain 
names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
<br /><br />
<b>Clear Gifs Information:</b> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are 
used to track the usage patterns of our users on the Service. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based 
emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information we collect from clear gifs 
used in email messages is used to enable more accurate reporting and make BurnerMap better for our users.
<br /><br />
<b>Third Party Services:</b> BurnerMap uses third party analytics services to help understand use of the Service. 
Third party analytics services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including 
cookies and your IP address, and their use of it is governed by their privacy policies. Additionally, other third 
parties may also use cookies, clear gifs, and other technologies to collect information, such as your IP address and 
other information about your use of, and activities on, the Service, and may use that information to deliver relevant 
advertisements and other content to you, on and off the Service. Their use and disclosure of the information they 
collect is governed by their privacy policies.
<br /><br />
<u>II. How We Use Your Information.</u>
<br /><br />
We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of 
the Service. We also use Personal Information to improve the Service, and to develop new products and services; to 
prevent abusive and fraudulent use of the Service and our other services and systems; to personalize and display 
advertisements and other content; and for other administrative and internal business purposes.
<br /><br />
Additionally, by providing BurnerMap your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you 
Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also 
agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. 
We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, 
special offers, and other information about our products and services and those of third parties. If you do not want 
to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences by sending an email to 
<a href="mailto:burnermap@gmail.com">burnermap@gmail.com</a>. If you opt out, please allow up to 10 business days for 
us to process your request. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, 
offers, and information about other products and services of BurnerMap or third parties.
<br /><br />
Following termination or deactivation of the Service, BurnerMap may retain any User information and User Content for a 
commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. 
<br /><br />
BurnerMap may use certain information about you and/or your User Content internally for purposes such as analyzing how 
the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.
<br /><br />
BurnerMap reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve 
the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason. BurnerMap also reserves the right to 
remove information upon the request of any third party.
<br /><br />
We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter 
it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) 
monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and 
demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated 
with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User 
Content and Users to comply with Law; and (i) automatically update the BurnerMap application on your system and related 
devices.
<br /><br />
<u>III. How We Share Your Information</u>
<br /><br />
<b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> BurnerMap will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to 
others. BurnerMap may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing 
the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We 
may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of BurnerMap (for instance, on servers or 
    databases co-located with hosting providers).
<br /><br />
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and other personal data 
is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such 
information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
<br /><br />
Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, 
becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you remove information that you 
posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have 
copied or saved that information.
<br /><br />
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, BurnerMap will not disclose personal information to any third 
party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the 
law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce a Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to 
investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement 
agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, 
or personal safety of BurnerMap, our Users or others.
<br /><br />
<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous 
    usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties 
for various purposes, including, without limitation, to help them understand the usage patterns for certain 
BurnerMap services.
<br /><br />
<u>IV. How We Protect Your Information</u>
<br /><br />
BurnerMap cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant 
the security of any information you transmit to BurnerMap or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be 
accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. The 
privacy of your personal information may also be affected by changes to the functionality of BurnerMap's distributors, 
such as social networks like Facebook, or the failure of privacy settings on such distributors' platforms. BurnerMap is 
not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.
<br /><br />
<u>V. Compromise of Personal Information</u>
<br /><br />
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, BurnerMap will promptly 
notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures 
set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
<br /><br />
<u>VI. Your Choices About Your Information</u>
<br /><br />
You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through the Service, in which case BurnerMap may not be able 
to provide certain services to you. You may review or correct the personal information about you that BurnerMap keeps 
on file by contacting us at <a href="mailto:burnermap@gmail.com">burnermap@gmail.com</a>
<br /><br />
<u>VII. Children's Privacy</u>
<br /><br />
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, BurnerMap does not knowingly collect 
or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the 
Service. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, 
telephone number, or email address. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child 
under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you 
believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:burnermap@gmail.com">burnermap@gmail.com</a>
<br /><br />
<u>VIII. Links to Other Web Sites</u>
<br /><br />
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or other services linked to or from the Service, nor the 
information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another 
website or service, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website or 
service, including those that have a link on our Service, is subject to that website's or service's own rules and 
policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
<br /><br />
<u>IX. Notification Procedures</u>
<br /><br />
It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other 
business related purposes, to you via email notice, "push" notification, written or hard copy notice, or through 
conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by BurnerMap in its sole discretion. We reserve the 
right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means 
of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br /><br />
<u>X. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</u>
<br /><br />
BurnerMap may update its Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. When we 
change the policy in a material way, we will update the 'last modified' date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Changes 
to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
<br /><br />
